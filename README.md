# Data Driven Auto - Portfolio Project


## Project Background

Data Driven Auto (DDA), established in 2010, is a prominent US-based auto dealer that over the years has built a robust business model centered around providing a diverse range of vehicles to meet the varying needs of consumers across the country.

Currently focused on expansion, DDA plans to harness its vast data on used car market sales and competitor activities accumulated over recent years to further growth in the coming years. This project aims to comprehensively analyze and synthesize the available data to uncover key insights that will support strategic decisions-making to move them closer to their growth goals.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Vehicle Profitability:** Evaluation of auto sales transactions with a focus on factors that impact profit margins including make, model, condition, etc.

- **Competitive Landscape:** Assessment of competitor transactions and volume to further understanding of market share

- **Sales Trend:** Historical sales patterns to identify any seasonal trends that may be present

- **Regional Comparisons:** An evaluation of regional sales market size

# Data Structure & Initial Checks

Data Driven Auto's database was originally compiled into one sheet with a total row count of 558,838. To allow for improved performance, flexibility and future scalability of the dataset by the end of the analysis it was divided into three tables: cars, sales and geo_lookup.

Prior to beginning the analysis, a variety of checks were conducted for quality control and familiarization with the datasets. The SQL queries used to inspect and clean the data for this analysis can be found here [link].

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
